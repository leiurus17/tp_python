How to run these files on Windows

Since we are using Python 2.7 on this tutorial, we should use the Python27 sources.

Go to:

C:\Python27

Copy the cgi-bin folder

Copy the html files on C:\Python27

Open CMD on C:\Python27

Then type: python -m CGIHTTPServer 8000

Then open a browser, type localhost:8000

Test your files

NOTE:

Do not run python -m SimpleHTTPServer, you'll get 501 error.
