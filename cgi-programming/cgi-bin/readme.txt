Since I'm programming using Python 2.7, I'm copying the files on C:\Python27 and then run
the CGI web server.

Go to C:\Python27 and then open a terminal.

And then type the following:

python -m CGIHTTPServer

That will start the webserver. Create a folder cgi-bin there and you're good to go.

For Python 3.x, run the server on your source directory.
